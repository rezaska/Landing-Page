# Front End Web Development Nanodegree - 2nd Project

This is a project built as an confirmation of finishing third chapter of Front End Web Development NanoDegree. It is a second of five projects which will be done to be able to graduate and receive a Front End Web Development NanoDegree certificate. We needed to convert a static project to an interactive one.
